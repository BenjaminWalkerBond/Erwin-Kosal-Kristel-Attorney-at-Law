        <h2>When your personal relationships are stressed, you need someone you can trust</h2>
        <p>I understand family law matters can be highly personal and very emotional. Divorce, child custody, child visitation, and child support are issues that create a lot of stress, partly because of the legal process but mostly because of what is at stake—your marriage and/or your children. There can be other highly sensitive circumstances such as domestic violence and child neglect. Sometimes, even government entities, such as Child Protective Services can be involved. All of this puts you on an emotional roller coaster, which makes it understandably difficult to make rational decisions. When dealing with these issues you need an attorney who is not only competent and aggressive, but compassionate and mindful of the life-impact any potential litigation may have and the circumstances that have led to where you are now. </p>
        <p>Even when a divorce or child custody is uncontested(meaning the parties have come to an agreement as to the outcome they want),you need someone on your side who you can trust to ensure you understand exactly what you are agreeing to. </p>
        <h2>Know your rights</h2>
        <p>Often divorce or custody battles seem to be all about negotiations, but you also have legally protected rights related to your property and children. If the other party is being unreasonable, you always have the choice to fight. You need a lawyer who will not only help you navigate the legal system, but who also works to understand your personal situation,clearly tells you what your rights are, and explains your options. </p>
        <p>Your life priorities come first and, based on those,together we will develop the best strategy to deal with the opposing side, the courts, and any other parties that might be involved. This can include court proceedings, mediation, communicating with Child Protective Services, or even restraining orders if needed. </p>
        <h2>How I work</h2>
        <p>When you contact me, I will start with a case evaluation,where I will listen to your story, review any relevant document, such as court orders, mediation agreements, and correspondence with Child Protective Services,after which we will together decide the best course of action. I will give you honest advice and will make sure you are fully educated on your rights and options. </p>
        <p>Family law cases can be relatively simple, such as an agreed divorce with no children and few assets, or highly complicated such as a highly contested divorce with child custody issues and complicated assets with,perhaps, one spouse hiding assets from the other. No matter what the situation,together we will design a specific plan and strategy which meets your priorities and which I will implement. Effective and aggressive, yet compassionate, representation while avoiding unnecessary court proceedings (and costs) is what I strive for.</p>
        <p>I understand that when you need to retain a family lawyer, your life is in chaos. I am flexible and will work around your schedule. If you or a loved one needs help with a family law matter, contact the Law Office of Erwin Kosal Kristel (<strong>281-815-4855</strong>). My office is located in Northwest Houston, close to Cypress.</p>
